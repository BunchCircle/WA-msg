Technical Implementation
Cryptography: Use standard Web Crypto API (AES-GCM) for encryption.
Storage: Since we are "no-backend", the encrypted payload will be stored in a URL Fragment (the part after the #).
Benefit: Fragments are never sent to the server, ensuring true end-to-end privacy for anyone hosting the site.
Destruction: For a truly "read-once" feature without a database, we will provide a "Burn after Reading" mode where the recipient must acknowledge the destruction.
